# Flood-Change-Detection
This Flood Monitoring App uses Google Earth Engine to analyze flood-affected areas via Sentinel-1 radar data. Users can draw an AOI, select a flood date, and analyze changes one month before and after. The app calculates flooded area (sq meters), displays results on the map, and includes a precipitation trend chart for the AOI.
